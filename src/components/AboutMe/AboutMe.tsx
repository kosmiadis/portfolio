            <p>I'm a <b>self-taught web developer</b> and <b>high school student</b> with a passion for building interactive, user-focused applications. I started learning programming at 14, fueled by curiosity and YouTube tutorials. Since then, I've developed a range of projects from real-time chat apps to full-stack tools like URL shorteners and digital bookshelves.</p>
            <p>My main stack includes <b>React, Node.js, MongoDB, and TypeScript</b>, and I love working on both the <b>frontend and backend</b>. Iâ€™m especially interested in modern UI libraries, real-time communication with WebSockets, and building tools that are not just functional, but enjoyable to use.</p>
            <p>I'm currently preparing for the National Exams to <b>study Computer Science at the University of Thessaloniki</b>. When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring design inspiration, reading tech blogs, working out, reading books or listening to music.</p>
